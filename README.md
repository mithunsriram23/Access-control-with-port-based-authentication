## üß† Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the implementation of *Access Control using Port-Based Authentication ** in a wireless network environment simulated in **Cisco Packet Tracer*.

The network includes a router, a wireless access point, and multiple wireless clients (PCs, laptops, and smartphones). Access to the network is restricted until the user authenticates via the access point, ensuring secure and authorized device connectivity.

## üåê Network Topology  
The simulated wireless LAN includes the following components:

- *1 x Router*  
  - Cisco 1941  
  - Connects the wireless LAN to external networks (simulated internet or intranet)

- *1 x Access Point*  
  - Wireless-PT model  
  - Central node for client device connections  
  - Handles authentication requests

- *8 x Client Devices*  
  - 3 x PCs (Desktop)  
  - 2 x Laptops  
  - 2 x Smartphones  
  - All connect wirelessly to the access point

## ‚öô Configuration Summary  
### ‚û§ Access Point  
- Wireless security enabled (WPA2 or similar)  
- MAC filtering and/or user authentication configured  
- Connected to the router for internet routing  

### ‚û§ Router  
- DHCP or static IP addressing (as per setup)  
- Interface configured to handle access point uplink  

### ‚û§ Clients (PCs, Laptops, Smartphones)  
- Wireless adapter enabled  
- Correct SSID and credentials used for connection  
- Authentication required to gain network access  

---

## üîÑ Workflow Demonstrated  
1. A device attempts to connect to the wireless access point.  
2. The access point initiates authentication via configured security settings.  
3. Upon successful authentication, the client is allowed onto the network.  
4. Authenticated devices can then communicate or access internet resources via the router.
